# University Records Management Tool

#### A variation of last yearâ€™s Object-Oriented Programming assignment, implementing a system to manage university records, including student enrollment, courses, and professor assignments. 
In particular, the program supports the following operations:
1. Add person to university records
2. Add course
3. Modify registered person
4. Modify existing course
5. Delete person from university records
6. Delete course
7. Assign professors to course
8. Get all students
9. Get all professors
10. Get professor's data
11. Get student's data

The algorithms and data structure operations used are not fully optimized for time complexity. However, they perform efficiently within this specific context, as the number of elements remains manageable.
